These examples use the Web Bluetooth API. This works only in Chrome, Edge, and Opera as of this writing.

## Examples
* [Web Bluetooth ButtonLED Read](web-bluetooth-buttonLED-read) - searches for a peripheral and subscribes to updates. This was written with the ArduinoBLE ButtonLED example in mind as the peripheral.
* [Web Bluetooth LED Write](web-bluetooth-LED-write) - searches for a peripheral and changes a characteristic with a button press when connected. This was written with the ArduinoBLE LED example in mind as the peripheral.
